/*************************************************************************
* Title: Polynomial Class 
* File: CIS278_Week12_10.11.cpp
* Author: James Eli
* Date: 2/18/2018
*
* Exercise 10.11 on page 495-496, Polynomial Class
*
* This is a short demonstration program of the polynomial class.
* 
* Develop class Polynomial. The internal representation of a Polynomial is 
* an array of terms. Each term contains a coefficient and an exponentâ€”e.g., 
* the term
*   2x^4
* Has the coefficient 2 and the exponent 4. Develop a complete class 
* containing proper constructor and destructor functions as well as set and 
* get functions. The class should also provide the following overloaded 
* capabilities:
*   a) Overload the addition operator (+) to add two polynomials.
*   b) Overload the subtraction operator (-) to subtract two polynomials.
*   c) Overload the assignment operator to assign one polynomial to another.
*   d) Overload the multiplication operator (*) to multiply two polynomials.
*   e) Overload the addition assignment operator (+=), subtraction assignment 
*      operator (-=), and multiplication assignment operator (*=).
*
* Notes:
*  (1) Degree, unary minus, stream and untested evaluate and differentiate 
*      methods added also.
*  (2) Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141).
*
* Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of PCC CIS-278.

*   04/12/2018: Added boost test file. JME
