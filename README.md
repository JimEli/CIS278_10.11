# Polynomial Class
## Pima CC CIS278 Week #12 
### Exercise 10.11

Exercise 10.11 on page 495-496, C++ How to Program, 10/e, Deitel

Develop class Polynomial. The internal representation of a Polynomial is an array of terms. Each term contains a coefficient and an exponentâ€”e.g., the term ```Text 2x^4 ``` has the coefficient 2 and the exponent 4. Develop a complete class containing proper constructor and destructor functions as well as set and get functions. The class should also provide the following overloaded capabilities:
* Overload the addition operator (+) to add two polynomials.
* Overload the subtraction operator (-) to subtract two polynomials.
* Overload the assignment operator to assign one polynomial to another.
* Overload the multiplication operator (*) to multiply two polynomials.
* Overload the addition assignment operator (+=), subtraction assignment  operator (-=), and multiplication assignment operator (*=).

Notes:
* Division, modulus, unary minus, [], comparison, stream and untested evaluate and differentiate methods/operators added also.
* Templated version.
* Uses Boost Test, compile release version if boost is not installed.
* Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141).
* Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of PCC CIS-278.
